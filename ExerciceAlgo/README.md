## THRESHOLD 0

Read the code. If any syntax bothers you, please ask me!!

## THRESHOLD 1

Implement a new algorithm (inherited from the Algo class) that implement the method :
```
virtual unsigned ListEntities(const sTeam& team, std::vector<sEntity>& entities, std::vector<sEntity*>& out) = 0;
```

This function takes a team and the list of all entities. It must retrieve all entities that belong to the given team.

Add an instance of this algorithm to the list of Algo in `main.cpp`. Then run the program. It will display the execution time of your algorithm.

## THRESHOLD 2

Improve your algorithm (or creating new ones) to reduce the execution time. Feel free to do everything you want to do so. (Adding members...)
